"How Large is the Effect of Monetary Policy on Safe Haven Asset Prices?" by Benjamin O'Sullivan

+------------------------------------------+

I estimate the time-varying effects of unanticipated monetary policy shocks on gold prices and a long-term US Treasury yield spread. I use a 
time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model. A high-frequency identification scheme is used to non-exactly identify the structural monetary policy
shocks. Both the model and the non-exact identification scheme are proposed by Paul (2020). Computing the relative impulse response functions of the 
structural model, I find that gold and the long-term US Treasury spread experience time-varying effects under a contractionary monetary policy shock. 
The long term Treasury spread further widens under a monetary tightening before and during the great recession, whereas gold has continually become 
more sensitive to monetary tightening over time.
